# L1 and L2 regularization

Overfitting is one of the most commom issues in machine learning.
To address overfitting issues L1 and L2 are regularization techniques used.

L1 - Lasso Regression
L2 - Ridge Regression

In this notebook I have implemented both the regularization techniques by working on housing dataset from kaggle.

Thank you!
